# GAS-AND-LDR-SENSOR-Project
#  INTRODUCTION
A sensor is a device that detects and responds to physical world
input.It is a module, machine, or subsystem that detects events
or changes in its surroundings and conveys the data to other
electronics, most frequently a computer processor.
In this project, we are using gas sensor for gas detection or the
presence and concentration of toxic or volatile organic
compounds (VOCs), humidity, and odors photoresistor, and also
a LDR known as light-dependent resistor, is a variable resistor
that is controlled by light.

#  OBJECTIVE
The project's goal is to detect the presence
and concentration of hazardous gases and
vapours, such as toxic or explosive gases. If
the gas sensor detects gas in a harmful
range, the buzzer sounds, the red led flashes,
and the LCD message "ALERT EVACUATE"
appears; otherwise, due to the LDR sensor
the green led glows and the LCD message
"SAFE ALL CLEAR" appears.
